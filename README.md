## What is SpaceXpanse ROD coin?
SpaceXpanse ROD coin is the native cryptocurrency of the SpaceXpanse Multiverse platform. And the ROD blockchain and its [core wallet](http://https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet "ROD core wollet") serve as the foundational layer in the platform, providing essential functions such as secure value and data storage, transaction processing, mining, and network connectivity for users to interact with the blockchain network. Additionally, the ROD core wallet serves as a tool for users to manage their ROD holdings and participate in various activities within the platform, further enhancing its utility.  


## What does SpaceXpanse ROD blockchain do?

✔ Create, store and transact its main cryptocurrency - ROD coin, fungible and nonfungible tokens /NFTs/.  
✔ Support two PoW algorithms: neoscrypt-xaya and SHA-256d - for merged mining, generating blocks every 30 seconds in 3 to 1 ratio.  
✔ Grant halving the block reward every year for 5 years, then ~3% annual inflation of the block reward for 59 years.  
✔ Allow register and transfer of arbitrary names /digital IDs/ for trustless user identification, which can hold and transfer value.  
✔ Provide a fair amount of secure data storage in every block, delivering possibility for near real-time communication between the nodes.  
✔ Support Atomic trading for exchange of in-game assets (fungible currencies as well as non-fungible items) in a trustless manner.  
✔ Possess Play-to-Earn functionality, which allows a part of the block rewards to be "placed" inside a decentralized application /DApp/, where users can pick/win them up and bank them to their on-chain address. /WIP/
